A Collection of Common Open Source License Templates
====================================================

Please contribute by forking and sending a pull request.  For the sake of 
making the merge process easier and faster, please only modify one file per 
commit.

For more information on Open Source Licenses, please see:

 * http://www.opensource.org/licenses/


Ideally, the contents of this project will provide the ability for GitHub to
automatically include a license file when a new repository is created (much 
like the way gitignore files are created now).

I welcome the Open Source Initiative to take over official ownership of this
project/repo as that would ensure accuracy and authenticity of the license
templates here within.

Guidelines
----------

 * Content submitted must be accurate, and copied directly from the above URL
 * Each line of a file must not exceed 78 characters.
 * The 'Source' URL must be included at the bottom of the license.
