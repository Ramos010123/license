A Collection of Common Open Source License Templates
====================================================

Please contribute by forking and sending a pull request.  For the sake of 
making the merge process easier and faster, please only modify one file per 
commit.

For more information on Open Source Licenses, please see:

Ideally, the contents of this project will provide the ability for GitHub to
automatically include a license file when a new repository is created (much 
like the way gitignore files are created now).
